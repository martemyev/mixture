How to build mixture library:

Linux

1. Go to the project directory (we'll call it 'mixdir')
  cd mixdir
2. Create directory for building files (cmake files, object files, mixture lirbary itself, etc - we'll call it 'build')
  mkdir build
3. Go to 'build' directory
  cd build
4. Start CMake to configure the project (note that CMakeLists.txt file with instructions for CMake is in parent directory, so we need to point this out)
  cmake ..
5. Build the library
  make
6. [optional] If doxygen is installed on your system, you can generate documentation just typing
  make doc
  After that find the documentation in html format in 'mixdir/doc/html' directory.
